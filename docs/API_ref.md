# TimeSeries API Reference

Welcome to the API reference of the TimeSeries Arduino library.

Here you will find detailed information on the classes, methods, and functions that make up the library.

If you are unsure of what to look for, take a look at the [API index](TimeSeries/annotated.md).

Alternatively, you can always jump directly to the [AR model class](TimeSeries/classts_1_1AR.md) or the [MA model class](TimeSeries/classts_1_1MA.md).
